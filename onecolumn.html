								<p>The Nike Magista Obras are a master piece of technology and comfort all in one. When it comes to describing the feel of the Magista Obras. One can say, it’s similar to that of putting on a pair of socks. This because it feels exactly like your putting on a pair of socks when you sporting these kicks. Yes, you still need to put on a pair of socks. The Nike Magista Obras feature a Flyknit Dynamic Fit Collar that looks like the top extension of your normal pair of socks. This increases comfort and overall control, probably the two most important things when playing soccer at all levels. Also, the All Conditions Control structure was designed for ultimate ball control. The Obras Fg are designed for Firm ground play on natural(not so wet) grass surfaces. With that being said, these cleats are so durable and multi-dimensional that firm, artificial and soft ground play should be just fine.</p>
					<p>Here is the talk of the town, the Nike Hypervenom Phantom II. Similar to the Magista Obras and the Mercurial Superly in design(has the same sock like fit collar). The difference is how Nike have put huge forcus into optimizing a cleat for performance and aesthetic design. The sock-like collar uses fused fly wire-like(cotton) cables for a seamless fit and has yet to be rivaled by any other brand. The upper of this new Phantom II is given a 3d textured look similar to the NikeSkin technology. The benefit being you’re first-touch will improve greatly during high-intensity matches. These boots also tout themselves as a no-brainer for wet or dry conditions. This hypervenom phantom II’s are built with an anatomically correct shape for a true glove-like fit on your feet. On the insole of this shoe, there’s a molded sock-liner cushion for your feet. This helps reduce pressure from your studs and is heaven sent if your flat-footed. I can’t stress enough how important is to feel comfortable in your cleats. If you plan at playing at an intense-level then these cleats are a considerable option. Even though they’re a bit pricey. Remember Comfort is key and the studs on the boots are made for superior traction and agility so you can stop and go as quickly as you want when you want.</p>
					<p>The Adidas X 15.1 is worn by the likes of Gareth Bale and Arjen Robben. This cleat was designed to suit these type of players and their style’s. The Adidas X was built with a TECHFIT COLLAR. Unlike the Nike fit collar the Ace 15.1 has a much smaller and more open extension. The short elastic collar sock offers a compressed fit around the ankle for support and promises a snug fit. The upper is made with the new X-SKIN, a revolutionary technology of composite material created through a 3-layer concept. Intricate indeed with a skin-thin lining for comfort, an engineered base layer for stability and durability and a topped transparent layer to protect and repel dirt and water from getting into your feet. The upper also features new NSG (NON STOP GRIP)for assisted ball control in all conditions. The adidas X15.1 is also constructed with X-CAGE for ultimate support during high agility movements through fragmented lightweight design. Meanwhile the lightweight new X-CLAW technology provides groundbreaking new stud configuration that enables the player to put more studs on the ball. A dream come true for the ruthless attacker.</p>
